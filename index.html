    <h1>Model Scope in AngularJS</h1>
    <em>Under Construction</em>
    <section>

        <h2>In Views and Controllers</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>When Controllers Nest</h3>
            The nested controller has access to any variables found on the parent controller's scope. It gets weird when
            you override those things though.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>In Forms</h3>
            <p>
                According to the docs, forms get their own controller (usually happens behind the scenes). This acts
                like nested controller scope as described above. A form's scope shouldn't be confused with a form's
                namespace, which is like a scope for validatable aspects of the form.

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>ng-repeat</h3>
            <p>
                Every repetition in an <code>ng-repeat</code> directive ends up with its own scope,
                nested in the parent controller's scope.
            </p>

            <h3>Isolated Scope</h3>
            The right way to take in or manipulate model data from the document hosting a directive is to give the
            directive it's own scope. You can then determine how data is marshalled from the hosting controller and the
            directive's own controller.

            <h3>Isolated Scope's effect on Sibling Directives</h3>
            <p>
                The <code>require</code> property of a directive is used to add other directives as siblings of this one.
                Unfortunately, the decisions you make around scope on your main directive will effect the scope of any
                sibling directives. In this example, we try to enable the use of the ng-model attribute in a custom directive.
                We would normally do this by making our directive a sibling of the out-of-the-box <code>ngModel</code>
                directive. This fails when we decide to make our directive have an isolated scope. This behavior is
                described in <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1924">AngularJS Issue 1924</a>
